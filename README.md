# GCP Cheatsheets

This repo contains a number of useful GCP useful commands, 
rangind from `gcloud` to its siblings (gsutil, kubectl, ..).

Anything GCP related pertains here. Feel free to drop me a PR to add stuff. And rather than copying from other resources, better to link them.

## Additional resources

These are much better than mine - come back when you've fagocitated them:

* GCP awesome cheat-sheet in colorful PDF format: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/images/gcloud-cheat-sheet.pdf
* kubectl cheasheet: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/ (which actually inspired me for this repo)
* `gcloud` cheatsheet: https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/cheatsheet
