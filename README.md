# GCP Cheatsheets

This repo contains a number of useful GCP useful commands, 
rangind from `gcloud` to its siblings (gsutil, kubectl, ..).

Anything GCP related pertains here. Feel free to drop me a PR to add stuff. And rather than copying from other resources, better to link them.

TODO(ricc): dockerize this to render MD into HTML and have SUPER fast cross link with left/upper navigation. Doing it right now.

## Naming Conventions

* Filename should follow the name of the command line you're going to use (`kubectl`, `docker` , ...).
* Most commands revolve around gcloud. There's a directory for you. Every gcloud subcommands (say gcloud compute) is under
  the gcloud directory with the name of the second worg (eg, compute.md).
* Avoid Pleonasms (Google, Cloud, GCP).
