# GCP Cheatsheets

This repo contains a number of useful GCP useful commands, 
rangind from `gcloud` to its siblings (gsutil, kubectl, ..).

Anything GCP related pertains here. Feel free to drop me a PR to add stuff. And rather than copying from other resources, better to link them.

## Conventions

* Filename should follow the name of the command line you're going to use (`kubectl`, `docker` , ...).
* Since the default is `gcloud` - everything else willl follow the product name. Note, I might rename in the future based on eityhe gcloud subcommand (then I'll create a dir). Let's see how this evolves, and how much confusion arises.
* Avoid pleonasms: 
  * if name contains Google, remove it as obvious (Google compute Engine -> Compute Engine)
  * if name contains Cloud, also remove it (Google Cloud Functions -> Functions )
