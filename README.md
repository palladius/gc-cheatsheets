# gcp-cheatsheets

This repo contains a number of useful GCP useful commands, 
rangind from `gcloud` to its siblings (gsutil, kubectl, ..).

Anything GCP related pertains here. Feel free to drop me a PR to add stuff. And rather than copying from other resources, better to link them.

## Thanks

I was inspired by this repo: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/
which is also PR-able :)
